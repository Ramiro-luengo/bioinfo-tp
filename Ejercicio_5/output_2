# 
# Prion protein (PrP) [1,2,3] is a  small glycoprotein found in high quantity in
# the brains of  humans  or animals  infected  with  a  number  of  degenerative
# neurological diseases such as  Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD),  scrapie
# or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).   PrP is encoded in the host genome
# and expressed  both  in  normal  and  infected  cells.  It  has  a tendency to
# aggregate yielding polymers called rods.
# 
# Structurally, PrP is  a  protein consisting  of  a signal peptide, followed by
# an N-terminal  domain  that contains tandem repeats of a short motif (PHGGGWGQ
# in mammals, PHNPGY in chicken), itself followed  by  a highly conserved domain
# of about  140  residues  that  contains a  disulfide bond.  Finally comes a C-
# terminal hydrophobic domain post-translationally  removed when PrP is attached
# to the extracellular side of the cell membrane by a GPI-anchor.  The structure
# of PrP is shown in the following schematic representation:
